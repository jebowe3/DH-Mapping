They wanted to find someone with whom to share cheaper quarters. The going rate at Watson's hotel would have been about six shillings per day. This means that Holmes and Watson needed accommodations that rented for between twelve and fifteen pounds a month. They went to inspect rooms at Mrs. Hudson's 221B Baker Street. Her accommodations included, \"A couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sitting room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows.” In later adventures, we learn that Watson’s bedroom was on the floor above, and Sherlock’s bedroom eventually had three doors: one leading to the sitting room, a second exiting into the hallway and later, a third door hidden behind the sitting room curtains. In 1881, the name “Baker Street” applied only that section of the modern street, south of Paddington Street. The portion of the street north of Paddington, to Marylebone was known as York Place. North of York Place, the street was called Upper Baker Street. As an added puzzle to Sherlockians, the highest house number, on nineteenth century Baker Street, was 85. This meant that Conan Doyle hid the true location of 221B, until he revealed it as today’s 31 Baker Street in the 1894 Adventure of the Empty House. During their first week at Baker Street, Watson learned that Holmes had acquaintances from all classes of society. Holmes explained that these were his clients, and that he was the world’s only “consulting detective.” One morning, Holmes received a note from Inspector Tobias Gregson, and showed it to Watson. The note said, “There has been bad business at 3 Lauriston Gardens, off Brixton Road.” Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland, Ohio had been murdered. Holmes explained that, “Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders”, and that, “He and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot.” Holmes asked Watson to get his hat.

This may be the first mention of Sherlock’s, now famous, dear-stalker hat. In the 1889 Hound of the Baskervilles, after Holmes and Watson met Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer at the Northumberland Hotel, they agreed that Watson would accompany Sir Henry to Baskerville Hall, on Saturday’s ten-thirty train from Paddington. Because of the press of other business, Holmes said he could not go at that time. In the 1890 Adventure of Silver Blaze, Holmes asked Watson to accompany him to the King’s Pyland training stable in Dartmoor. Silver Blaze, the horse favored to win the Wessex Cup, was missing, and his trainer murdered. Holmes and Watson were just in time to catch the Dartmoor train from Paddington. On the trip, Holmes wore his ear-flapped traveling cap, (A reference to his famous deerstalker). As an amusement, he calculated the train’s speed by observing and timing the passing telegraph poles.

In the 1883 Adventure of the Speckled Band, Helen Stoner left Leatherhead on the first train to Waterloo Station. She wanted to consult Holmes on the strange events at Stoke Moran. Later in the day, Holmes and Watson left London for Leatherhead from Waterloo Station. In the 1885, Adventure of The Five Orange Pips, John Openshaw arrived in London at Waterloo Station. After Openshaw visited Holmes, he tried to catch the late train back to Horsham, but on the way to the station, he was attacked and killed. One summer night in 1888, at the beginning of The Adventure of the Crooked Man, Watson was staying up late. His wife and the rest of the household had gone to bed, when there was a knock at the door. It was Holmes, who had just come from Waterloo Station. He had arrived from Aldershot, and asked Watson to accompany him when he returned the next day. In 1889, during The Adventure of The Naval Treaty, Holmes and Watson caught an early train from Waterloo Station. to Briarbrae, Percy Phelp’s home. It was a large detached house; just a few minutes walk from Woking Station. Later that day, when Holmes and Watson returned to London, they ate at the Waterloo Station’s buffet. Later in 1889, Scotland Yard assigned Inspector Lestrade to the case Watson called The Adventure of the Cardboard Box. Lestrade sent a note from Croydon, asking for Holmes help. Holmes and Watson left for Croydon from Waterloo Station. Also in 1889, Dr. Mortimer did not know what to tell Sir Henry when he arrived at Waterloo Station. Sir Henry was the last of the Baskervilles, and Dr. Mortimer felt hesitant about telling the young baronet about The Hound of the Baskervilles. Holmes said he needed twenty-four hours to think about the problem, and advised Mortimer to say nothing of the curse until then. Later in the adventure, Waterloo Station is where cabbie John Clayton dropped off his fare after he had followed Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer. Although young Cartwright failed to find the hotel from which the note was sent, Holmes did locate the driver of the hansom cab. His name was John Clayton, who lived at the fictional Turpey Street in the Borough of Southwark. Clayton said that his fare was a detective. When Holmes asked the name he had given, Clayton replied, “Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” Holmes burst into a hearty laugh, and told Watson, “This time we have…a foeman who is worthy of our steel”. Conan Doyle gave 3 Turpey Street as John Clayton’s fictitious street address. Since Clayton kept his horse and cab at Shipley’s Yard, near Waterloo Station, we can assume he lived nearby. In 1890,, as now,, trains from London to Winchester leave from Waterloo Station. In The Adventure of the Copper Beeches, Holmes and Watson’s train left Waterloo Station at half-past nine, and arrived in Winchester at 11:30. They were curious about Violet Hunter’s predicament, since she had the freedom to meet them in Winchester. On a Monday in 1895, Watson caught the 9:13 train from Waterloo Station.
