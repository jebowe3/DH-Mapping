## Week 8: Basic Tech and Techniques for Digital Cartography
In this class, we will walk through some of the basics of doing GIS in the digital humanities. For this, we will focus on open source approaches, making use of free desktop GIS software ([QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/)) and a versatile text editor ([Atom](https://atom.io/)). Using QGIS, we will see how to map a [spreadsheet](spreadsheet/SHERLOCK_HOLMES_LONDON.csv) containing points of interest from the Sherlock Holmes series of detective stories. In this case, I downloaded these points from a pre-existing project ([The London of Sherlock Holmes](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?ll=51.510345653313024%2C-0.12769532132744787&z=14&mid=11hi6OwDoifyUI4kFsg7suBQm1t8)) and have cleaned and prepared this dataset for our purposes, but it is good to keep in mind that data preparation and cleanup are fundamental steps in most GIS work.
